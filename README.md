# GitHub Copilot CLI (Public Preview)

The power of GitHub Copilot, now in your terminal.

GitHub Copilot CLI brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your command line, enabling you to build, debug, and understand code through natural language conversations. Powered by the same agentic harness as GitHub's Copilot coding agent, it provides intelligent assistance while staying deeply integrated with your GitHub workflow.

See [our official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) for more information.

## 🚀 Introduction and Overview

We're bringing the power of GitHub Copilot coding agent directly to your terminal. With GitHub Copilot CLI, you can work locally and synchronously with an AI agent that understands your code and GitHub context.

- **Terminal-native development:** Work with Copilot coding agent directly in your command line — no context switching required.
- **GitHub integration out of the box:** Access your repositories, issues, and pull requests using natural language, all authenticated with your existing GitHub account.
- **Agentic capabilities:** Build, edit, debug, and refactor code with an AI collaborator that can plan and execute complex tasks.
- **MCP-powered extensibility:** Take advantage of the fact that the coding agent ships with GitHub's MCP server by default and supports custom MCP servers to extend capabilities.
- **Full control:** Preview every action before execution — nothing happens without your explicit approval.

We're still early in our journey, but with your feedback, we're rapidly iterating to make the GitHub Copilot CLI the best possible companion in your terminal.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Supported Platforms

- **Linux**
- **macOS**
- **Windows**

### Prerequisites

- (On Windows) **PowerShell** v6 or higher
- An **active Copilot subscription**. See [Copilot plans](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans?ref_cta=Copilot+plans+signup&ref_loc=install-copilot-cli&ref_page=docs).

If you have access to GitHub Copilot via your organization or enterprise, you cannot use GitHub Copilot CLI if your organization owner or enterprise administrator has disabled it in the organization or enterprise settings. See [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization](http://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-github-copilot-features-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization) for more information.

### Installation

Install with [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) (Windows):

```bash
winget install GitHub.Copilot
```

```bash
winget install GitHub.Copilot.Prerelease
```

Install with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/copilot-cli) (macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install copilot-cli
```

```bash
brew install copilot-cli@prerelease
```

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot) (macOS, Linux, and Windows):

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot@prerelease
```

Install with the install script (macOS and Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

Or

```bash
wget -qO- https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

Use `| sudo bash` to run as root and install to `/usr/local/bin`.

Set `PREFIX` to install to `$PREFIX/bin/` directory. Defaults to `/usr/local`
when run as root or `$HOME/.local` when run as a non-root user.

Set `VERSION` to install a specific version. Defaults to the latest version.

For example, to install version `v0.0.369` to a custom directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | VERSION="v0.0.369" PREFIX="$HOME/custom" bash
```

### Launching the CLI

```bash
copilot
```

On first launch, you'll be greeted with our adorable animated banner! If you'd like to see this banner again, launch `copilot` with the `--banner` flag.

If you're not currently logged in to GitHub, you'll be prompted to use the `/login` slash command. Enter this command and follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate.

#### Authenticate with a Personal Access Token (PAT)

You can also authenticate using a fine-grained PAT with the "Copilot Requests" permission enabled.

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Under "Permissions," click "add permissions" and select "Copilot Requests"
3. Generate your token
4. Add the token to your environment via the environment variable `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (in order of precedence)

### Using the CLI

Launch `copilot` in a folder that contains code you want to work with.

By default, `copilot` utilizes Claude Sonnet 4.5. Run the `/model` slash command to choose from other available models, including Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5.

### Experimental Mode

Experimental mode enables access to new features that are still in development. You can activate experimental mode by:

- Launching with the `--experimental` flag: `copilot --experimental`
- Using the `/experimental` slash command from within the CLI

Once activated, the setting is persisted in your config, so the `--experimental` flag is no longer needed on subsequent launches.

#### Experimental Features

- **Autopilot mode:** Autopilot is a new mode (press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through modes), which encourages the agent to continue working until a task is completed.

Each time you submit a prompt to GitHub Copilot CLI, your monthly quota of premium requests is reduced by one. For information about premium requests, see [About premium requests](https://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

For more information about how to use the GitHub Copilot CLI, see [our official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli).

### 🔐 Authentication, sessions, and model requests (quick reference)

- **How account connection works:** `/login` uses GitHub's OAuth device flow in your browser, then persists OAuth credentials (access/refresh token pair) locally for future sessions.
- **PAT alternative:** set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a fine-grained PAT that has **Copilot Requests** permission.
- **Token refresh/session maintenance:** for OAuth login, the CLI manages token lifecycle automatically. For PAT auth, rotation is your responsibility.
- **How model communication works:** the CLI sends prompts/tools context to GitHub Copilot APIs, and GitHub routes the request to the selected model provider. Use `/model` to change models and `/usage` to inspect session usage.

Example curl commands (using a token from `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`):

```bash
TOKEN="${GH_TOKEN:-$GITHUB_TOKEN}"

# 1) Verify which account/token is active
curl -sS https://api.github.com/user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"

# 2) Check API rate-limit budget for this token/account
curl -sS https://api.github.com/rate_limit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"

# 3) Check Copilot billing/usage for the authenticated user (if available on your plan)
curl -sS https://api.github.com/user/copilot/billing \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"
```

### 🔁 Multi-account router strategy (design guidance)

If you want to rotate across multiple GitHub accounts:

1. Keep one token per account (e.g., in a secret manager).
2. Before each request, query `GET /user` and `GET /rate_limit` for each account and collect:
   - account login
   - remaining/reset for API rate limit
   - optional Copilot billing endpoint response (if accessible)
3. Apply a selection policy (e.g., pick account with highest normalized remaining budget, or weighted round-robin with cooldown on 429/403).
4. Route your request using that account's token.
5. Record request count + estimated premium usage from CLI `/usage` output to keep your own per-account ledger.

Notes:
- GitHub does not currently provide a public API endpoint that returns a complete **per-model hard limit table** for an account in real time.
- For model availability and entitlement, use `/model` in the CLI and handle runtime quota/rate-limit errors with retry + account rotation.

## 🔧 Configuring LSP Servers

GitHub Copilot CLI supports Language Server Protocol (LSP) for enhanced code intelligence. This feature provides intelligent code features like go-to-definition, hover information, and diagnostics.

### Installing Language Servers

Copilot CLI does not bundle LSP servers. You need to install them separately. For example, to set up TypeScript support:

```bash
npm install -g typescript-language-server
```

For other languages, install the corresponding LSP server and configure it following the same pattern shown below.

### Configuring LSP Servers

LSP servers are configured through a dedicated LSP configuration file. You can configure LSP servers at the user level or repository level:

**User-level configuration** (applies to all projects):
Edit `~/.copilot/lsp-config.json`

**Repository-level configuration** (applies to specific project):
Create `.github/lsp.json` in your repository root

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "lspServers": {
    "typescript": {
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"],
      "fileExtensions": {
        ".ts": "typescript",
        ".tsx": "typescript"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Viewing LSP Server Status

Check configured LSP servers using the `/lsp` command in an interactive session, or view your configuration files directly.

For more information, see the [changelog](./changelog.md).
